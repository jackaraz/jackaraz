### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![cv](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=plastic&label=CV&message=jackaraz.github.io&color=blue)](https://jackaraz.github.io)

I'm a postdoc at Stony Brook University, and I'm interested in collider phenomenology, machine learning, and quantum computing.
You can find my papers on [Inspire-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1599325).

When I'm not coding, though, I mostly [bike](www.whiskyandwheels.ca), [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/jackaraz/), and climb on stuff!

**Here is some software that I'm part of:**
- [MadAnalysis 5](http://madanalysis.irmp.ucl.ac.be) - event analysis and recasting package
- [Spey](http://spey.readthedocs.io) - smooth inference for reinterpretation studies
- [SModelS](https://github.com/SModelS) - A tool for interpreting simplified-models results from the LHC
- [Rivet](https://gitlab.com/hepcedar/rivet) - Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory
- [Elvet](https://gitlab.com/elvet/elvet) - a neural network-based differential equation and variational problem solver
- [research-related software in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jackaraz)
