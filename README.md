### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![cv](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=plastic&label=CV&message=jackaraz.github.io&color=blue)](https://jackaraz.github.io)

I'm a [Theoretical High Energy Physicist](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1599325) and software developer currently located at [The Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology - Durham University](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/profile/jaraz/)! These days I'm highly fascinated by collider phenomenology and classical/quantum machine learning.

When I'm not coding tho, I mostly bike, [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/jackaraz/) and climb on stuff!

**Here is some software that I'm part of:**
- [MadAnalysis 5](http://madanalysis.irmp.ucl.ac.be)
- [Elvet](https://gitlab.com/elvet/elvet)
- [research related software in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jackaraz)
